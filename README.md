# longest-word

## How to Run
- Clone the project 

	`git clone https://github.com/mashmn/longest-word.git`
	
- To Run the application which finds the longest word, run MyApp.java -> Run as Java Application.

- To Run the test cases, run the test suite AllTests.java -> Run as JUnit Test

### Test Cases:
There are two 2 test cases:
1. LongestWordTest.java -> to test sentence with unicode, alphanumeric and other non alphabets.
2. FailTest.java -> Negative test case - This *test case will fail* as MyApp.java does not recognize sentence containing multiple words with same longest length.

## Setup
- JUnit 4.12 as dependency
